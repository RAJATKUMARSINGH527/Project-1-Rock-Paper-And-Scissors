# Rock Paper Scissors Game

Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game project! In this project, we'll develop a simple command-line version of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors" using Python.

## Overview

The project aims to demonstrate basic Python programming concepts while implementing a fun and interactive game. The game will allow a player to compete against the computer in multiple rounds of Rock Paper Scissors.

## Features

- *User Input*: Players can input their choice of "rock", "paper", or "scissors".
- *Random Selection*: The computer randomly selects its choice.
- *Game Logic*: The game logic determines the winner based on the choices made by the player and the computer.
- *Score Tracking*: The game keeps track of the player's and computer's scores throughout multiple rounds.
- *Multiple Rounds*: The game continues until the player decides to quit.
- *User-Friendly Interface*: The game provides clear instructions and prompts for the player.

## Technologies Used

- *Python*: The core programming language used for development.
- *Random Module*: Utilized for generating random selections for the computer's moves.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

1. *Project1RockPaperScissors.py*: The main Python script containing the game logic.
2. *README.md*: This Markdown file providing an overview of the project.
3. *LICENSE*: The license file defining the terms of use for the project.

## How to Play

1. *Clone the Repository*: Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:


    ```
        git clone https://github.com/RAJATKUMARSINGH527/Project-1-Rock-Paper-And-Scissors.git
    ```    



2. *Navigate to the Project Directory*: Move into the directory where the project is cloned.

3. *Run the Game*: Execute the Python script Project1RockPaperScissors.py using the Python interpreter:


    ```
        python Project1RockPaperScissors.py
    ```    


4. *Follow the Prompts*: The game will prompt you to enter your choice for each round. Type "rock", "paper", or "scissors" and hit Enter.

5. *View Results*: After each round, the game will display the result, including who won the round and the current score.

6. *Play Again or Quit*: You can choose to play another round or exit the game when prompted.
